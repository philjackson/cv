        ApiAxle is an opensource, lightweight API management
        solution that handles all the boring stuff and let's you
        focus on your product. ApiAxle was aquired by Exicon in
        early 2014.

      <p>
        ApiAxle enjoyed rapid growth and was often touted as the goto
        solution for open, on-premise API management. The project grew
        - almost completely organically - from tens of downloads a
        month to more than 500 at time of writing. ApiAxle currently
        powers several high traffic commercial APIs.
