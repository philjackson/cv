      <p>
        ApiAxle is an opensource, lightweight API management
        solution that handles all the boring stuff and let's you
        focus on your product. ApiAxle was aquired by Exicon in
        early 2014.
      </p>

      <p>
        ApiAxle enjoyed rapid growth and was often touted as the goto
        solution for open, on-premise API management. The project grew
        - almost completely organically - from tens of downloads a
        month to about 500 a month now.

        Before the sale Phil was seeking to recruit a CEO, but until
        the aquisition was a sole-founder so all aspects of software
        development and the day-to-day running of the business were
        within his remit, including:
      </p>
