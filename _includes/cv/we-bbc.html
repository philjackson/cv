        Part of a ten strong team working on the iPlayer meta data
        API. The API was conceived as a very fast, de-normalised API
        which would be used dynamically, primarily by the iPlayer
        interface itself. This meant scaling the system to many
        billions of calls a month which brought about sharding various
        database systems and implementing detailed monitoring systems
        to ensure performance and availability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lead of the performance team which involved keeping the API
        fast enough for use with, amongst others, iPlayer.

        Products written in 'modern Perl' with MySql at the
